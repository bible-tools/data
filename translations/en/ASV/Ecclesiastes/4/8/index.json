{"chapter":4,"text":"There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, <FI>saith he<Fi> , do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.","verse":8,"name":"Ecclesiastes 4:8"}
