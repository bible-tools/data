{"chapter":66,"text":"He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as he that breaketh a dog&#x92;s neck; he that offereth an oblation, <FI>as he that offereth<Fi> swine&#x92;s blood; he that <FI> burneth frankincense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations:","verse":3,"name":"Isaiah 66:3"}
