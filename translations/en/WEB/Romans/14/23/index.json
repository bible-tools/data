{"chapter":14,"text":"But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isnâ€™t of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.     Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.   ","verse":23,"name":"Romans 14:23"}
