{"chapter":29,"text":"It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isnâ€™t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.","verse":8,"name":"Isaiah 29:8"}
