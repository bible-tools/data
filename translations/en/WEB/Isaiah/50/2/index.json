{"chapter":50,"text":"Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it canâ€™t redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.","verse":2,"name":"Isaiah 50:2"}
