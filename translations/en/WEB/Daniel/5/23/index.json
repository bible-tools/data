{"chapter":5,"text":"but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which donâ€™t see, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, you have not glorified.","verse":23,"name":"Daniel 5:23"}
